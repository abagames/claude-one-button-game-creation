pinclimb.md is a markdown file with game rules, objects, skeleton code to implement object behavior, and final source code. Please create a similar markdown for the attached *.js file.

Each item in the markdown contains the following information:

# Game rules

A concise set of game rules. Focus on:
- Game Environment
- Core Mechanics
- Player Interaction
- Challenge

Avoid complex mechanics like:
- power-ups
- rhythm
- maze
- energy
- scoring systems
- win/lose conditions
- end game conditions
- difficulty adjustment

# Game objects

Details of the game objects (maximum 3 types). For each object, specify:
- Properties (e.g., position, size, state)
- Initial state
- Shape (use simple geometric shapes)
- Color (choose from: red, green, yellow, blue, purple, cyan, black)
- Behavior (movement patterns, interactions)
- One-button controls (if applicable)
- Collision events
- Spawning rules
- Scrolling (if applicable)

Avoid complex mechanics like:
- scoring systems
- win/lose conditions
- end game conditions
- difficulty adjustment

# Skelton code

A skeleton JavaScript code structure with comments outlining the implementation of game rules. Include:
- Variable definitions for game objects
- update() function structure
- Placeholders for object behavior implementation

# Source code

An implemented code of the game logic using the crisp-game-lib library, translating each comment in the skeleton into functional JavaScript.
