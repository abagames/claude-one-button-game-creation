## Tag Summaries
- **on_holding:thrust**: Accelerate forward or upward with the player character. By holding the button longer, the player can achieve higher speeds, whereas shorter presses result in lower speeds, allowing for more precise control.
- **field:roughness**: The terrain is uneven. The behavior of movement and jumping is affected by the slope of the terrain. The uneven terrain can also act as obstacles or cover.
- **field:spike**: There are terrains in the game that result in game over upon contact. The player must avoid areas with spikes by jumping or moving to progress.
