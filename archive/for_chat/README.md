## Why Archived?

This version focused on documentation and methodology for human-LLM collaborative game development using crisp-game-lib. The project has been refreshed with a new focus on **mobile-first game development workflow** combining Claude Code, Netlify branch deploys, and automated validation systems. The new version introduces:

- TypeScript-based implementation (migrated from JavaScript)
- 6-phase structured workflow with automated validation
- Tag-based game design system with constraint verification
- Novelty metrics and similarity checking
- Co-evolutionary balance tuning via genetic algorithms
- Mobile-first prototyping with instant preview URLs
- Dual-deployment strategy (Netlify for dev, GitHub Pages for production)
